# Cozy Cup Cafe

## Project Description

CozyCafe emerged from a passionate endeavor by two close friends, Nick Brienne Martinez and John Aivanne Molato, who shared a profound love for the artistry and science behind coffee brewing. Their friendship began during their college years, where they bonded over their shared interests and aspirations. Drawing inspiration from their experiences and fueled by their mutual admiration for Italian coffee culture, they embarked on a journey to bring the authentic flavors of Italian coffee craftsmanship to their community in the heart of downtown Seattle.
